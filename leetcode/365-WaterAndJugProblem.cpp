// The classical "Water and Jug" problem.
// The Math knowledge behind it is BÃ©zout's identity:
//      If d is the gcd of two integers a and b, then d must equal to ax + by, x and y are integers.
//      And d is the smallest integer which can be written as that.
//      So, if z is a multiple of gcd(x, y), it's true, becase z = ax + by,
//          if a (or b) is positive, it means filling x (or y) jug up a times,
//          if a (or b) is negative, it means emptying x (or y) jug down b times.
